# CMS (Content Management System) Research & Planning

This folder contains comprehensive research and planning documentation for implementing a Content Management System for the Developer Guideline application.

## 📋 Overview

The goal is to create a CMS that allows non-technical users to manage developer guideline content efficiently, with:
- **Production Deployment**: OpenShift with PostgreSQL database
- **Local Development**: Docker Compose environment
- **Modern UI/UX**: Following industry best practices

## 📁 Documentation Structure

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [01-feasibility-analysis.md](./01-feasibility-analysis.md) | Technical feasibility assessment and recommendations |
| [02-cms-options-comparison.md](./02-cms-options-comparison.md) | Comparison of headless CMS platforms (Strapi, Payload CMS, Directus) |
| [03-ui-ux-best-practices.md](./03-ui-ux-best-practices.md) | UI/UX research and design patterns for CMS interfaces |
| [04-architecture-design.md](./04-architecture-design.md) | System architecture for OpenShift and Docker deployment |
| [05-implementation-roadmap.md](./05-implementation-roadmap.md) | Phased implementation plan with milestones |
| [06-component-integration-mapping.md](./06-component-integration-mapping.md) | **NEW** Mapping of existing components to CMS content blocks |

## 🎯 Key Decisions to Make

1. **CMS Platform Selection**: Strapi vs Payload CMS vs Directus vs Custom Build
2. **Content Model Design**: How to structure guideline content
3. **Authentication Strategy**: SSO integration vs local accounts
4. **Media Management**: Storage strategy for images and assets
5. **Deployment Architecture**: Resource allocation and scaling strategy

## 🚀 Quick Start

After reviewing the documentation, proceed to the implementation roadmap for step-by-step guidance on building the CMS.
