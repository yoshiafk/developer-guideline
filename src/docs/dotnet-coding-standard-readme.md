**Recommended for new developers** - A concise, easy-to-follow guide covering:
- Essential naming conventions
- DDD (Domain-Driven Design) implementation patterns
- Entity Framework best practices
- File organization
- Code formatting standards
- Common templates and examples

### 2. dotnet-coding-standard-guide.md
**Comprehensive reference** - Detailed documentation including:

- Security considerations
- Enterprise patterns

## Quick Start for New Developers

1. **Start with** `dotnet-clean-architecture-standards.md` for immediate productivity
2. **Reference** `dotnet-coding-standard-guide.md` for detailed scenarios and advanced topics
3. **Follow** the project's existing code patterns when in doubt
4. **Use** the provided templates for consistent implementation

## Key Principles

- **Clean Architecture**: Maintain clear separation of concerns
- **DDD Pattern**: Focus on domain modeling, aggregates, value objects, and domain services
- **Async/Await**: Use consistently for all I/O operations
- **Validation**: Implement using FluentValidation
- **Testing**: Write comprehensive unit tests
- **Documentation**: Document complex business logic

## Getting Help

- Review existing code in the project for practical examples
- Check unit tests for usage patterns
- Refer to the project's README.md for setup instructions
- Ask team members for clarification on project-specific patterns

## Updating Standards

These documents evolve with the project. When contributing:
- Ensure examples are from actual project code
- Keep standards aligned with Microsoft conventions
- Update both documents when making significant changes
- Validate examples actually compile and work

*These standards are based on Microsoft conventions, Clean Architecture principles, and standardized design patterns.*
